			<p>In previous years, psychology in sports has experienced a great rise. It become almost impossible to imagine the everyday work of a professional esport player without the presence of a sports psychologist. From my humble experience (trust me on this one), what psychology can do for a professional player in a short period of time is far from the ability of any strength & conditioning coach. We are also witnessing an increasing incidence of cases of severe anxiety and depression among professional athletes. For that reason, the first article in 2021. is the guest blog post from our contributor Marta Tutić, Sports Psychologist. Below we convey her thoughts on motivation – a key factor that can make a significant difference between a champion and an average player.

Motivation is a key determinant of behavior in any sport. It is a complex construct, with athletes having diverse and dynamic motives for initiating, directing, sustaining, and terminating effort. Athletes can be motivated by internal or external factors, or a combination of both, which may vary by context and time.

Achieving goals can become a powerful motivator in athete’s life. A lot of people live for reaching their goals. That need is their motivation to accomplish different challenging tasks effectively and quickly. Those players with a high need of achievement tend to work harder than their teammates without it and they are also more future oriented. Their plans include numerous goals and because of that they are able to delay gratification longer than others. As David McClelland, american psychologist, said achievement-based people tend to make sacrifices and make their goal their “life,” so they work around the things that may not be related to their sport, academia, or whatever they are motivated to do. They spend their time learning how to get better and be effective.</p>
